🚀 **Project Highlight: Bill Generator System – Java Console Application** 💻🧾

I'm excited to share my latest project – a **Bill Generator System**, a console-based application built using **Java** that simplifies and automates the billing process for various domains like retail, services, and e-commerce.

### 💡 Project Overview:
This system is designed to **automate invoice generation**, eliminating manual errors while ensuring speed, accuracy, and efficiency in handling transactions.

### 🔧 Key Features:
✅ **Dynamic Bill Creation** – Captures product/service details (name, quantity, unit price, taxes) and generates professional bills instantly.  
✅ **Itemized Billing** – Breaks down each transaction, showing item-wise cost, total, taxes, and optional discounts.  
✅ **Customizable Inputs** – Supports company name, customer details, date, and other fields for a personalized touch.  
✅ **File Handling** – Bills are saved externally (TXT/CSV) for future reference and record-keeping.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Java (Core Java)** – Backend logic and console interface  
- **File I/O** – Storing and retrieving bill records

### 🌟 Planned Enhancements:
📌 **GUI Interface** – Integrate a user-friendly graphical interface using Swing or JavaFX  
📌 **Email Support** – Send bills directly to customer emails with a click  
📌 **Database Integration** – Use MySQL or SQLite for persistent, structured bill storage and advanced queries

This project helped me strengthen my Java programming skills and understand real-world application design involving user input, data management, and reporting.

🔗 I'm open to feedback, collaboration, or ideas on how to improve this further!
